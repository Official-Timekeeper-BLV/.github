# Official Timekeeper BLV
Hi there! We are the official timekeeper for Bayerischer Leichtathletikverband e. V. Bezirk Oberbayern.

## What we do
We provide time- and scorekeeping services for track and field.
On most summer weekends, you will often find us in various track and field stadiums across Bavaria.
Sometimes, you may also meet us in a stadium outside of Bavaria, as we also provide timing services for other commercial track and field events.

If you want to learn more about our services, feel free to visit our [website](https://blv-sport.de/bezirke/oberbayern/service-ua-veranstaltungen).

## Who we are
We are a team of passionate people who are lending a huge part of our free time to track and field.
With a unique combination of nerdiness, love for track and field and addiction to adrenaline, we all found the perfect hobby here to pour our hearts into.

## Want to join us?
If you...
- share our passion for track and field and technology
- you want to be behind-the-scenes of cool sports events and
- you live in or close to Bavaria

...you are very welcome to join us.

You can always ask any of us if you see us in a stadium or you can reach out to us through our [website](https://blv-sport.de/bezirke/oberbayern/service-ua-veranstaltungen).
Note that we mostly work as volunteers and therefore only receive volunteer compensation for most of the events that we do.

## Repositories hosted here
Because of the nature of what we do, the code we host here is all private.
If you wish to collaborate with us on one of our projects or wish to buy any of our products or services, feel free to reach out to us through our [website](https://blv-sport.de/bezirke/oberbayern/service-ua-veranstaltungen).
